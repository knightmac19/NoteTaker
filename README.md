# NoteTaker

A heroku-hosted note-taking application utilizing a server and multiple types of routes to transfer information between client and server. 


## User Story
- As an adult
- I WANT a note-taking application
- SO THAT I can keep track of what I need to get done & what I've already done

## Description

This project required students to:
- set up a server using Express.js
- use several "get" routes to serve HTML pages & api endpoints
- use a "post" route to input user data onto an api endpoint (JSON object)

Upon initialization the user is brought to a landing page with the title "Note Taker." A button in the center of the page redirects to another HTML page which allows the user to write, read, save, and delete notes.
